Learn the fundamental concepts behind creating a chatbot that can have meaningful and natural conversations. You will learn about the Watson Assistant service and the building blocks of a conversation including intents, entities, slots, digressions, handlers and dialogs. We will also use context variables to remember our users and not get too annoying!
