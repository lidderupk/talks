Spark and PixieDust! What cool names! They also happen to be two of my favorite open source tools to explore and analyze data (also known as "data wrangling" in the cool circles!).

We are going to dive into both of these tools and explore a dataset. We will look at what makes data noisy and what to do with this "noise." You will also build some pretty cool visualizations using PixieDust! At the end of the workshop, you will have an idea on how to write an interesting and intriguing notebook or report, and how to build a portfolio over time.
