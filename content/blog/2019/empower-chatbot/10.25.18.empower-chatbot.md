We built a basic chatbot in part I. We continue the journey by adding more digressions and handlers to our bot thereby giving it a personality. Additionally, we will explore the more advanced features in Watson Assistant using the JSON editor. Finally, we will add a backend service layer built on IBM functions and IBM cloud. This enables our chatbot to queries other systems and databases to better assist the user during a conversation. We will go into the two types of communications offered in Watson Assistant - server and client.
