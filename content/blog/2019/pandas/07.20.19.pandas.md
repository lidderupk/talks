Join IBM Developer SF to get an introduction to Apache CouchDB - an open-source document-oriented database software that focuses on ease of use and having a scalable architecture.

A database in CouchDB is not a group of tables, but a collection of documents (JSON objects). We will use Cloudant, a hosted version on IBM Cloud, for the demo to avoid spending time installing locally.

We will look at how to create a simple CRUD application in CouchDB and then explore more advance features including:
1. Design Documents to transform, update and validate documents
2. Views to query documents using MapReduce
3. Mango Query Server to write JSON queries
4. HTTP API that makes CouchDB ideal for the web
