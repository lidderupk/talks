IBM and Postman are partnering up to show you how to use open source tools to create and test scalable and secure APIs!

Application programming interface, or APIs, are essential to any solution or software and need to be tested individually and in integration with other moving pieces. Testing APIs as an activity can be owned by the developers, the QA testers, or both. The QA team generally does not have access to the code. They write scripts and harnesses to test the APIs. We will show you how easy it is to use Postman to create test cases and scripts that can be run automatically on APIs created on serverless platforms!
