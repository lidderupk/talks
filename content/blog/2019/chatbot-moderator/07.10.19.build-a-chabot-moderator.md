~~~~~~

Most of us use some sort of messaging/collaboration applications in our work places. Join us in this hands-on online meetup to create a chat moderator from scratch. We will be using the following services during the workshop:

- Natural Language Understanding: to detect different sentiments and emotions in text sent in Slack channels
- Visual Recognition: to detect offensive images sent in Slack channels
- Apache OpenWhisk: to glue together different pieces and create a complete application
Who is this workshop for?
- Junior developers who want to see how to glue together different services and build an application from scratch
- Learn about hooking together different APIs using Serverless as the glue
- Developers interested in learning more about IBM services on the cloud
- Fun folks who want to do some pair programming!
